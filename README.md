# LeafRules
LeafRules converts trained Decision Trees into NumPy-based rules using np.where or np.select. It extracts decision paths, transforming tree models into interpretable, rule-based logic for fast execution. Ideal for model debugging, rule extraction, and deploying lightweight decision logic efficiently in NumPy-based workflows.
